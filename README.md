# ADB Wrapper

A very simple adb wrapper to promt me to select Android Device, in case i have multiple devices connected, which i usually do.

Installation is pretty simple, just clone or download this repository, and add a shell alias for adb, i.e for bash:
````bash
alias adb="/path/to/adb_wrapper/adb.sh"
````

## This project is using  [Inquirer.sh](https://github.com/tanhauhau/Inquirer.sh) library.
